I've been making music since around late 2017 (so quite recently at the time of writing - 06/01/2019).
Until recently I've been way to filled with imposter syndrome and a general disatisfaction with what I've recoreded.

But, I am so into making music, I have a few synthesisers and a sampler / sequencer which I'm all learning simultaneously. While trying to fit in a bit
of theory learning here and there. Oh and a bit of musical programming. 
It's all very new to me and I love it 
So, I'm very hopeful (very fucking hopeful!) that I begin to gradually share more music + code.

I've already started this year by taking part in the [Disquiet Junto's](https://disquiet.com/) (one so far at time of writing), which I really hope to keep up.
Here is a playlist of my compiled Juntos:
