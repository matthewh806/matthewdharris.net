## Recording Notes
In my current setup I'm using a digitakt, minibrute, 0-coast and a volca FM synthesiser. 
And using Ableton as my DAW / more soft instruments

I find the 0-coast can be quite unwieldy and sometimes difficult to incporporate into a track 
as a result. It is capable of producing some really lovely and beautiful tones though. 
So I decided to go back to basics with it and read through the manual again as I play with it.

I had a basic patch with a sine wave LFO modulating the number of overtones and type of overtones (even, odd, mixed etc)
in the sound. I'm also playing around with some of the knobs in realtime. 

It has quite a lot of reverb and delay from Ableton mixed into the sound too.

## General thoughts
I can't remember the last time I remembered a dream.
