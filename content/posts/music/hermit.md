## Preamble
I've recently gotten into the habit of keeping a pen & paper musical diary. But I realised that, as useful as that is
to me, it misses the crucial aspect... the music!

I briefly wondered if there was some kind of musical blogging platform that would suit my needs, then remembered
I have a much neglected personal domain in which I could achieve what I wanted.

I spend quite a lot of time noodling away with hardware and sometimes stumbling upon nice tones and rhythms, sometimes not.
Frequently I have no desire to turn these fragments of audio into a full track and so I throw them away.
Which is a bit of a shame, so I've decided to occasionally capture these sounds and gradually to build up
a collection of sound sketches that form a kind of sonic diary of my life.

These are in no way intended to be polished or complete works, but more of an offshoring of my feelings and 
activities at a specific point in time to the wider world. I'm hoping it can serve as a digital memory
of a time now irretrievably lost to the past. A morsel of proof that at some stage in the history of the universe I existed and 
attempted to express myself...

I'm already worried about the excessive overhead or "admin" tasks that are required to keep this kind of thing 
active and the dangers of trying to capture every mundane sound I create. So, I'm hoping to exercise a bit of 
restraint and only create entries a couple of times a month. 

## Recording Notes
This was recorded using a Minibrute 2, a revereb pedal and a frequency echo VST.
I used a looping AD envelope to modulate the amplitude.
I hooked up a relatively slow sawtooth LFO to modulate the frequency of the filter. 

This is the beginning of a 10 day period where I will be on my own. Hence the name.
